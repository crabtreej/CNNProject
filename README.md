# CNNProject
Project Github for Neural Nets (5526)

Pipfiles included have tensorflow, sk-learn, and a few other libraries already installed.
If you don't know what pipenv is, I highly recommend you go learn about it, then install pipenv
for Python3. It automatically manages Python dependencies, and means that if we all work on 
the project in the pipenv defined, then everyone will be using the same version of all the
libraries, plus every time someone adds a new one through pipenv, it will get added to the file.
Then everyone gets it the next time they pull and activate pipenv, so there's no versioning
headaches.

I found a nice tutorial for setting up a CNN to work on the MNIST-Fashion dataset, it might
be a good starting point for us. Of course, we can also use whatever dataset we want, Dr.
Hamm recommended Cifar.
