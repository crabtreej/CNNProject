In simplifiedBaselineMax simplifedBaselineAverage:
1.  Modify the Conv2D layer to have reasonable parameters for number of channels and
    kernel size (research what might be good choices). Come up with two choices for each of
    these.
2.  Come up with good values for pool size and stride for the average and max pooling operations.
    Again, do two for each size and stride.
3.  Once both one AND two are completed, run the models with all these permutations so we have 
    the results for a one layer model with reasonable parameters.
4.  Repeat 3 with 2 and 3 layer models.

I know this is a pretty high level overview, but this should be really straightforward, we
just need to throw time and computing power at the problem now. I'm not sure this is honestly
enough differences in the various values, there's really nothing to graph or show here with
just two data points, but I'm not sure what else to do given the time frame.
